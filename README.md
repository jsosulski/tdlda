# Time-decoupling in covariance matrices for LDA for ERP classification

This repository contains the time-decoupling method as described in [1]. For details, please refer to the paper available [here](
https://rdcu.be/ccd0g). The implementation can be used as a drop-in replacement for an sklearn classifier.

If you want to reproduce the results from our paper [1], please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/jsosulski/time-decoupled-lda/tree/neuroinformatics_submission).
